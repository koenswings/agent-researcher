# HEARTBEAT.md — Programme Manager

Periodic checks to run during heartbeat polls (2-4 times per day):

## Check: Backlog
- Are there newly approved items in `../../BACKLOG.md` under "Programme Manager" that aren't in progress?
- If so, note them in today's memory file for the next active session.

## Check: Pending drafts
- Are there drafts (grant proposals, newsletters, teacher guides) awaiting CEO review in this workspace?
- Flag anything that has been sitting for more than 3 days without a response.

## Check: Grant deadlines
- Are there upcoming deadlines in `grant-tracker.md`? Flag anything within 4 weeks.

## Check: Field reports
- Are there field partner messages awaiting synthesis into structured reports?

## Check: Memory
- Review `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files from the past 3 days
- Update `MEMORY.md` with anything worth preserving long-term
- Clear stale notes from `MEMORY.md` that are no longer relevant
