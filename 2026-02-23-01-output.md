# Insights from OpenClaw Use Cases Transcript (2026-02-23)

Relevant insights for the IDEA project from a video covering personal OpenClaw setups.

## 1. soul.md is a separate file from identity.md

The distinction is now clearer:
- `identity.md` = who the agent is (name, role, description)
- `soul.md` = how it communicates — tone, verbosity, formality, humor

Crucially, **soul.md can be context-aware**. He configures his agent to be
informal/personal in private chat but formal/colleague-like when invoked in
Slack where others can see. For IDEA, agents like `communications` could apply
a similar rule — internal drafts vs. externally-facing content have different
register expectations.

## 2. The multi-agent council pattern

He runs 8 specialist agents in parallel, each reading the same data
independently, then a synthesiser merges and ranks their findings. He has three
councils: business, security, platform.

This is directly applicable to IDEA:
- The `quality-manager` could run a small council (architecture, testing,
  documentation specialists) rather than a single-perspective review
- A nightly **platform council** — checking documentation drift, log health,
  backup status — maps almost exactly onto the Pi's operational needs

## 3. Security practices for external content ingestion

His approach:
- Deterministic (traditional) code sanitises all external data *before* any
  LLM touches it
- "Summarise, don't parrot" — never pass raw external content verbatim to the
  model
- Restrict to read-only permissions on all external services (no write to
  email, calendar, etc.)
- Auto-redact secrets from logs
- Pre-commit hook to prevent committing sensitive data

For IDEA, `fundraising` and `communications` will ingest external content
(grant databases, partner sites, news). These practices should be specified in
their `AGENTS.md`.

---

## 4. Prompt engineering guide stored locally

He downloads model-specific prompting best practices from each provider and
stores them locally. Any time OpenClaw updates a prompt or markdown file, it
references that guide.

For IDEA: a file like `hq/prompting-guide-opus.md` (since dev agents use Opus)
would give all agents a consistent reference when they self-update their own
instructions.

## 5. Backup strategy for always-on machines

Hourly: encrypt all SQLite databases → upload to remote storage. Hourly: git
autosync. Alert immediately on any failure.

The Pi needs exactly this — it's unattended, and losing agent memory or work
history would be painful.

---

## 6. Self-improving prompts and memory synthesis

When he rejects an extracted action item, the agent learns *why* and updates
its own prompt. He also has a nightly memory synthesis job that distils
conversation history into `memory.md` and updates identity files.

IDEA agents will accumulate domain knowledge over time (grant landscape, code
architecture decisions, school deployment lessons). The memory synthesis
pattern is worth designing in from the start rather than bolting on later.

## Not Relevant to IDEA

Personal CRM, food journal, knowledge base for video ideas, image/video
generation — all personal assistant use cases with no equivalent in a charity
operations context.
