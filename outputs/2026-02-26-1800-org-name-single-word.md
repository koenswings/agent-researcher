> **Question:** I do not really like it when names consist of multiple words. Can you come up with single-word alternatives (even the word idea can be replaced)?

# Single-word org name candidates

## Summary table

| Name | GitHub | Domain (.org) | Notes |
|------|--------|---------------|-------|
| `edufrica` | ✅ Available | ✅ Likely available | edu + africa portmanteau |
| `funzika` | ✅ Available | ✅ Likely available | Swahili root: funza = to educate/teach |
| `ideafrica` | ✅ Available | ❌ Taken (since 2022) | IDEA + africa portmanteau |
| `afridea` | ✅ Available | ❌ Taken (since 2025) | africa + idea |
| `taaluma` | ✅ Available | ❌ Taken (since 2024) | Swahili: learning/studies |
| `educafrica` | ✅ Available | ❌ Taken (since 2009) | Three syllables, less clean |

Everything else checked (elimu, soma, akili, hekima, nuru, mwanga, etc.) was taken on GitHub.

## The two viable candidates

### `edufrica`
Portmanteau of *edu* + *africa*. Clean, readable, pronounceable in any language.
Immediately clear to any reader: education + Africa.
Works as a domain, a GitHub org, and spoken aloud.

### `funzika`
From Swahili *funza* (to educate, to instruct). The *-ika* suffix adds a sense of "make it happen". Less immediately obvious to a non-Swahili reader, but distinctive and rooted in the region.

## Recommendation

**`edufrica`** — two recognisable words fused into one, instantly readable with no
explanation needed. It works at every touchpoint: github.com/edufrica,
edufrica.org, and spoken aloud to a donor or partner.

`funzika` is a strong second if you want something with deeper regional roots and
are prepared to explain it occasionally.

## Action
- Confirm choice before creating the GitHub org
- Register the .org domain immediately after deciding (~€10–15/year)
