# IDEA Virtual Company — Build Log

Chronological record of completed steps in configuring the IDEA virtual company.
Cross-references the "What Needs to Happen" backlog in the proposal.

---

## Phase 1 — Design decisions (pre-2026-02-26)

These items were resolved before the current research conversation began.
They are marked `[x]` in the proposal backlog.

### GitHub org name
**Decision:** Use `idea-edu-africa` as the GitHub org name.
**Status:** Superseded — see Phase 3 below. Decision deferred; proceeding under
`koenswings` while the name is finalised.

### Repos set up under koenswings
**Repos created:** `engine`, `openclaw`, `idea-proposal` (now `agent-researcher`)
**Status:** Done. Repos renamed in Phase 3.

### VS Code / Claude Code / tmux session pattern
**Decision:** One tmux session per agent, named `claude-<project>`. Each agent
has its own Claude Code session scoped to its project directory.
**Status:** Done. Convention is in use across all agents.

### AGENTS.md file structure
**Decision:** One repo per agent. Each agent workspace contains an `AGENTS.md`
file defining the agent's role, scope, and constraints.
**Status:** Decided. Files to be written during agent workspace creation (Phase 4).

### Shared agent knowledge
**Decision:** Single `CONTEXT.md` at the org root (`/home/pi/idea/CONTEXT.md`).
All agents read from the same file. No per-agent copies.
**Status:** Decided. File to be written in Phase 4.

### Standup model
**Decision:** Roundtable standup format. CEO seeds a markdown file with context;
each agent appends its section in one session. Discussion threads in `discussions/`.
@-mention convention for cross-agent questions.
**Status:** Decided. Templates and scripts to be created in Phase 4.

### Operating layer
**Decision:** Mission Control from day one as the primary task management tool.
No spreadsheets or BACKLOG.md as primary source of truth.
**Status:** Decided. Mission Control already running alongside OpenClaw.

### BACKLOG.md export
**Decision:** `scripts/export-backlog.sh` queries the Mission Control REST API
and generates `BACKLOG.md` as a read-only snapshot for agents.
**Status:** Decided. Script to be written in Phase 4.

### Website technology
**Decision:** Static site on GitHub Pages.
**Status:** Decided. Framework (Astro or Hugo) still to be confirmed.

### Teacher guide delivery
**Decision:** All three delivery channels — Engine-served, Console-embedded,
and printable PDF.
**Status:** Decided. Pipeline design still to be done.

## Phase 2 — Proposal and tooling (2026-02-26)

Work done in the initial research conversation with Compass.

### Proposal restructured (2026-02-26)
**What:** `research/openclaw-initial-config/proposal.md` restructured for
progressive disclosure:
- Added "What is OpenClaw?" subsection
- Moved Mission Control before Complementary Tools
- Added clickable Table of Contents
- Reordered all 22 sections from general → specific
- Added `app-openclaw` section (system disk model, repo structure, IDEA config separation)
- Added backlog items for `app-openclaw` repo and setup script
**Output:** proposal.md (committed to agent-researcher)

### PDF generation toolchain fixed (2026-02-26)
**What:** `md-to-pdf.ts` in the engine project fixed to generate portable PDFs
with working internal hyperlinks.
- Added `addHeadingIds()` post-processing (markdown-it does not emit id attributes)
- Replaced `wkhtmltopdf` with Chromium headless (`chromium --headless --print-to-pdf`)
- `wkhtmltopdf` embeds `file:///tmp/...` URIs that break on other machines;
  Chromium generates proper internal GoTo PDF destinations
- Added `installChromium()` to `Engine.ts` / `buildEngine()`
**File changed:** `/home/pi/idea/agents/agent-engine-dev/script/md-to-pdf.ts`
**Tool:** `cd /home/pi/idea/agents/agent-engine-dev && ./md-to-pdf <input.md> <output.pdf>`

### Engine repo migration plan (2026-02-26)
**Question answered:** How to migrate engine repo to agent-engine-dev with history
and Claude memory preserved.
**Answer:** `mv` preserves git history; copy Claude memory dir before first session
at the new path. Both done in Phase 3.
**Output:** `outputs/2026-02-26-1545-engine-repo-migration.md`

### OpenClaw architecture — separation from idea repo (2026-02-26)
**Question answered:** Should openclaw be merged into the idea repo?
**Answer:** No. Keep separate. Add `idea/openclaw/` config folder to the idea repo
for IDEA-specific config (agent roster, no tokens). openclaw repo holds the
generic platform.
**Output:** `outputs/2026-02-26-1530-openclaw-in-idea-repo.md`

### app-openclaw architecture (2026-02-26)
**Question answered:** How to model openclaw as a deployable platform.
**Answer:** Generic platform in `app-openclaw`; IDEA-specific config layered via
`idea/scripts/setup.sh`. Clear separation between platform and organisation.
**Output:** `outputs/2026-02-26-1610-app-openclaw-architecture.md`

### app-openclaw repo structure (2026-02-26)
**Question answered:** Should openclaw be restructured as `app-openclaw` following
the app-* template?
**Answer:** Yes. Follow the template exactly (`compose.yaml` with `x-app` metadata,
`init_data.tar.gz`). Will not auto-instantiate via Engine (OpenClaw is Pi-resident,
not a dockable app) but the template gives structural consistency and forward
compatibility.
**Output:** `outputs/2026-02-26-1645-app-openclaw-repo-structure.md`

### System disk evaluation (2026-02-26)
**Question answered:** Can `build-app-instance` provision openclaw onto a permanently
attached USB SSD as a "system app"?
**Answer:** Architecturally sound. The key unknown is whether chokidar fires `add`
events for devices already attached when the Engine boots. Test with a trivial app
first before committing to this for openclaw.
**Output:** `outputs/2026-02-26-1700-app-openclaw-system-disk-evaluation.md`

### Org name review (2026-02-26)
**Question answered:** Review available GitHub org names; check domain availability.
**Answer:** `idea-edu-africa` — GitHub ✅, domain ✅. All close variants (`idea-africa`,
`ideaafrica`, `idea-edu`) taken. `idea-schools` and `idea-digital-africa` available
but less precise. Recommendation: `idea-edu-africa` for GitHub, `idea-schools.org`
for public website.
**Output:** `outputs/2026-02-26-1730-org-name-review.md`

### Single-word name search (2026-02-26–2026-02-27)
**Question answered:** Single-word alternatives to `idea-edu-africa`.
**Round 1:** `edufrica` (edu + africa) — GitHub ✅, domain ✅.
`funzika` (Swahili: to educate) — GitHub ✅, domain ✅.
All Swahili education words (elimu, soma, akili, etc.) taken on GitHub.
**Round 2 (idea combinations):** Four clean options — all GitHub ✅, domain ✅:
- `ideabora` (Swahili: excellent/the best)
- `ideamoja` (Swahili: one/united)
- `ideaweza` (Swahili: can/is able)
- `ideakazi` (Swahili: work/mission)
**Decision:** Name decision deferred. Proceeding under `koenswings`.
**Outputs:** `outputs/2026-02-26-1800-org-name-single-word.md`,
`outputs/2026-02-26-1810-org-name-idea-combinations.md`

## Phase 3 — Repo migrations (2026-02-27)

### GitHub repo renames
**What:** Three repos renamed on GitHub under `koenswings`:
- `engine` → `agent-engine-dev`
- `openclaw` → `app-openclaw`
- `console` → `agent-console-dev`
**How:** `gh repo rename <new-name> --repo koenswings/<old-name> --yes`
**Effect:** GitHub sets up automatic redirects from old URLs. All existing
links and clone URLs continue to work as long as the old names are not reused.

### engine — local migration
**What:** Engine repo moved from `/home/pi/projects/engine` to
`/home/pi/idea/agents/agent-engine-dev`.
- Claude memory copied: `/home/pi/.claude/projects/-home-pi-projects-engine/memory/`
  → `/home/pi/.claude/projects/-home-pi-idea-agents-agent-engine-dev/memory/`
  (preserves full memory for the next engine-dev session)
- Git remote updated: `git@github.com:koenswings/agent-engine-dev.git`
- Push verified: `Everything up-to-date`

### app-openclaw — remote update only
**What:** Git remote updated to `git@github.com:koenswings/app-openclaw.git`.
Directory left at `/home/pi/openclaw` — Docker is running from that path;
moving it would break the live system.

### console — GitHub rename only
**What:** Renamed on GitHub to `agent-console-dev`. No local copy on Pi.

---

## Phase 4 — Workspace structure and AGENTS.md deployment (2026-02-27)

### Step 4 — `/home/pi/idea/` directory structure (partial)
**What:** `agents/` subfolder created under `/home/pi/idea/` housing all agent repos.
**Status:** Partial. Org root coordination files (`CONTEXT.md`, `ROLES.md`, `PROCESS.md`,
`BACKLOG.md`, `standups/`, `discussions/`, `design/`, `proposals/`, `scripts/`) not yet
deployed — staged in `research/openclaw-initial-config/idea/` awaiting deployment.
**Note:** `/home/pi/idea/engine/` also exists — old OpenClaw sandbox from when agent was
named "engine" (pre-rename). Contains SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md,
HEARTBEAT.md, BOOTSTRAP.md. Not a git repo. Superseded by new sandbox path.

### Step 6 — Docker volume mount updated ✅
**What:** `compose.yaml` bind mount changed from `/home/pi/projects` → `/home/pi/idea`.
**Effect:** All agent workspaces under `/home/pi/idea/agents/` now visible inside
the OpenClaw container at `/home/node/workspace/agents/`.
**Commit:** `0a5f16a Mark Docker volume mount step as complete in proposal backlog`

### Step 7 — GitHub repo renames ✅ (partial — already in Phase 3)
Three repos renamed; new repos for site-dev, quality-manager, programme-manager still
to be created (pending org name decision).

### Step 8 — Agent workspace directories created ✅
**What:** All six agent directories now in place under `/home/pi/idea/agents/`:
- `agent-engine-dev/` — migrated from `/home/pi/projects/engine`
- `agent-researcher/` — was already in place (this workspace)
- `agent-console-dev/` — cloned from `koenswings/agent-console-dev`
- `agent-site-dev/` — new git repo initialised
- `agent-quality-manager/` — new git repo initialised
- `agent-programme-manager/` — new git repo initialised
**Commit:** `5801fb2 Mark agent workspace creation as complete in proposal backlog`

### Step 9 — AGENTS.md copied to all agent workspaces ✅
**Date:** 2026-02-27

Copied from `research/openclaw-initial-config/agent-<role>/AGENTS.md` into each
workspace root:

| Workspace | Action | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `agent-engine-dev/` | Replaced existing `AGENTS.md` | Old file had wrong SOUL/USER paths (`../SOUL.md`), wrong title ("Engine Agent"), missing BACKLOG ref. Replaced with approved version. |
| `agent-console-dev/` | Created new `AGENTS.md` | — |
| `agent-site-dev/` | Created new `AGENTS.md` | — |
| `agent-quality-manager/` | Created new `AGENTS.md` | — |
| `agent-programme-manager/` | Created new `AGENTS.md` | — |

Note: `agent-researcher/` uses `CLAUDE.md` not `AGENTS.md` (Claude Code CLI, not
OpenClaw). Its `CLAUDE.md` was already in place.

---

### Step 10 — Apply updated `openclaw.json` ✅
**Date:** 2026-02-27

Live config was at `/var/lib/docker/volumes/openclaw_openclaw-data/_data/openclaw.json`.
Old config had two agents with stale ids and paths:
- `engine` → workspace `/home/node/workspace/engine`
- `console-ui` → workspace `/home/node/workspace/console-ui`

Backed up to `openclaw.json.bak`, then wrote the new config with all 6 agents:

| Agent id | Workspace |
|----------|-----------|
| `engine-dev` | `/home/node/workspace/agents/agent-engine-dev` |
| `console-dev` | `/home/node/workspace/agents/agent-console-dev` |
| `site-dev` | `/home/node/workspace/agents/agent-site-dev` |
| `quality-manager` | `/home/node/workspace/agents/agent-quality-manager` |
| `programme-manager` | `/home/node/workspace/agents/agent-programme-manager` |
| `researcher` | `/home/node/workspace/agents/agent-researcher` |

Token carried over from the live config. The staged `openclaw.json` in the researcher
repo keeps its placeholder — the token must not be committed to git.

OpenClaw **not yet restarted** — sandbox files (step 11) must be in place first.
