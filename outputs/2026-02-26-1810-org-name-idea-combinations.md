## The four clean candidates

### `ideabora`
*bora* in Swahili means "excellent" or "the best". Reads naturally in English too —
"Idea Bora" could even be a brand name standalone. Positive connotation, aspirational.

### `ideamoja`
*moja* = one. "One IDEA" — unity, simplicity, focus. Short, punchy. Works without
knowing any Swahili: it sounds like a name.

### `ideaweza`
*weza* = "can" or "is able". Resonates with the empowerment mission: IDEA that
enables. Less intuitive to outsiders but strong in meaning.

### `ideakazi`
*kazi* = work, task, mission. "IDEA at work". Direct and grounded. Slightly more
functional than aspirational.

## Recommendation

**`ideabora`** — aspirational, short, memorable, and works bilingually (English
speakers can say it without instruction). The Swahili meaning reinforces the mission
without needing explanation.

**`ideamoja`** is a strong alternative if you prefer simplicity and unity as the
core message.

Both are fully available on GitHub and as .org domains.
