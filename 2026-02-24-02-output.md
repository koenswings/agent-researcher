### Changes made to openclaw-brainstorm.md

**Decision #11 — Option D (file system structure)**
- Agent roster table: updated workspace paths for all 4 coordination agents (no longer `hq/<agent>`, now `/home/pi/projects/<agent>`)
- HQ directory structure: removed all agent subdirs; hq is now purely coordination content
- Option D description in File System Structure section: decision cross-reference replaces old inline block
- `What Needs to Happen`: updated step 5 (7 new repos, not 3) and step 6 (7 new directories)
- Project Repositories table: now shows all 10 repos (3 existing + 7 to create)

**Decision #12 — Mission Control from day one**
- CEO Tools section: replaced original tool stack with MC-first version (was a duplication; now canonical)
- MC section: removed deferral recommendation ("launch without it first")
- MC "Retired" bullet → "Adapted" bullet: BACKLOG.md auto-exported, not retired

**Decision #13 — BACKLOG.md auto-export**
- New "BACKLOG.md Export" subsection in MC section: mechanism, script, format, usage

**Decisions section: expanded from 7 to 13 items**
All resolved decisions now in one place, including the 6 previously only in inline blocks (memory, standup format, CONTEXT.md, file structure, MC operating layer, BACKLOG.md).

**Inline "Decision ✅" blocks replaced with cross-references**
- Agent Memory → `→ Decision: ... See Decision #4`
- Multi-Agent Dialogue → `→ Decision: ... See Decision #3`
- File System Structure → `→ Decision: ... See Decision #11`
- Shared Agent Knowledge → `→ Decision: ... See Decision #5`

**Other**
- Complementary Tools: Plane marked as replaced by Mission Control
- Current Backlog: 5 decisions now checked off; 2 new backlog items added (MC setup, export script)
- Duplicate Revised CEO Tool Stack / Typical CEO Day removed from MC section (canonical version is now in CEO Tools section)

### Changes made to workspaces/hq/PROCESS.md

- "The Backlog" section: Mission Control is now source of truth; BACKLOG.md is read-only auto-export
- Step 3 (CEO approval): merging PR now creates a MC task (not a BACKLOG.md entry)
- Step 4: describes MC task creation + export script run (not manual BACKLOG.md edit)
- Worked Example step 6: updated to show MC task creation
- CEO Approval Chain: Mission Control added as task dispatch layer
