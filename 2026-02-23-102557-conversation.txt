● Which document do you want to print? And let me find the engine project
  location and script first.

● Searched for 3 patterns, read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Found it — md-to-pdf.ts in /home/pi/projects/engine/script/. Which document do
   you want to print?

● The script takes an input path and optional output path. I'll run it from the
  engine directory, passing the full path to the brainstorm doc and outputting
  the PDF back into this project.

❯ Can I use Obsidian to browse the .md files in this project? Or are there  
  other markdown rendering tools I can use to remote ssh into this project  
  and brwose its content?                                                   

● Yes, a few good options:

  Obsidian — Open the project folder as a vault. But Obsidian runs locally, so
  you'd need to either:
  - Mount the Pi's filesystem on your local machine via SSHFS, then point
  Obsidian at the mounted folder
  - Or use Obsidian Sync / Git plugin to sync the repo to a local vault

  VS Code Remote SSH — You already have a .vscode/ folder here, so this is
  probably the most natural fit. Install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.co
  m/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh extension, connect to the Pi,
  open this folder, and you get full markdown preview with Ctrl+Shift+V.

  grip — Renders markdown as GitHub-flavored HTML, served locally over HTTP.
  Install with pip install grip, run grip openclaw-brainstorm.md, then open the
  URL in your browser. Works well over SSH with port forwarding.

  mdbook — Converts a folder of markdown into a navigable website you can serve
  and browse. More setup but great for a document collection like this.

  Given you already have VS Code set up with the tmux terminal profile, VS Code 
  Remote SSH is probably the path of least resistance. Want help setting that
  up?

❯ How can I mount the Pi's file system on my Mac? Can this be done          
  permanently - without blocking my Mac in case the Pi is down?             

● Install the tools (one-time):
  brew install --cask macfuse
  brew install gromgit/fuse/sshfs-mac
  macFUSE requires approving a kernel extension in System Settings → Privacy & 
  Security after install, then a reboot.

  Basic mount:
  mkdir -p ~/mnt/pi
  sshfs pi@<pi-ip>:/home/pi ~/mnt/pi -o
  reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3

  ---
  For permanent, non-blocking mounting — use autofs

  This is the right approach. macOS's automounter mounts the filesystem on 
  demand (when you navigate to the path) and never blocks your Mac if the Pi is
  down — the path just won't respond until the Pi is reachable again.

  1. Add to /etc/auto_master:
  /mnt/pi   auto_pi
  2. Create /etc/auto_pi:
  pi  -fstype=sshfs,reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3
  :pi@<pi-ip>:/home/pi
  2. This mounts at /mnt/pi/pi when accessed.
  3. Reload autofs:
  sudo automount -vc

  ---
  Caveats:
  - You'll need SSH key auth (no password prompt) — which you likely already
  have
  - macFUSE's kernel extension can occasionally cause issues after macOS updates
  - If the Pi is down and you cd to the mount path, it will hang briefly then
  time out — but it won't affect the rest of your Mac

  Want help setting up SSH key auth to the Pi if you don't have it already?

❯ set up SSH key auth to the Pi 

● I'm running on the Pi, so I can set up the Pi side. You'll need to run one
  command on your Mac. Let me check the current state first.

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● No authorized_keys yet. Here's what to do:

  On your Mac, run:
  cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub 2>/dev/null || cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 2>/dev/null ||
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "mac"

  This prints your existing public key, or generates one if you don't have one
  yet. Then paste the output here and I'll add it to the Pi's authorized_keys.

❯ SHA256:yPqCMHCaXih7uMHxpXd469dAmgkDChOntKkQQVMF90I 

● That's a key fingerprint, not the public key itself. I need the full public
  key — it looks like this:

  ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAA... your@mac

  On your Mac, run:
  cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

  And paste the full output here.

❯ Here is the key: ssh-ed25519                                              
  AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMlIyR5gN9KVEOeQl4cAsJOho/2ZprcyXhxTof8BKBQ2  But 
   I have to tell you it was generated without the -C "mac" option because  
  there was a newline in the command. Is this still ok then?                

● Yes, the comment (-C "mac") is just a label — it has no effect on
  authentication. The key works fine without it.

● Bash(mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && echo "ssh-ed25519
      AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMlIyR5gN9KVEOeQl4cAsJOho/2ZprcyXhxTof8BKBQ2" >>
      ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmo…)
  ⎿  SSH is enabled and the default password for the 'pi' user has not been
      changed.
     This is a security risk - please login as the 'pi' user and type 'pass
     … +5 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Done. Now test it from your Mac — open a new terminal (not your current SSH
  session) and run:

  ssh pi@<pi-ip>

  It should connect without asking for a password. Once confirmed, SSHFS and VS
  Code Remote SSH will both work passwordlessly.
