## Topic: How the PR-based proposal and content workflow works

---

### Question
In the brainstorm doc, what does this mean in practice:
- "Website content goes in `website/content-drafts/` as PRs for `site-dev` to implement"
- "Draft proposals in `proposals/` as PRs for CEO approval before any submission"

Is "PR" a GitHub Pull Request, or something else?

---

### Answer

Yes — these are literal GitHub Pull Requests. The PR is both the review mechanism and the container for the artefact (the proposal document or content draft).

### `proposals/` as PRs — CEO approval flow (fundraising agent)

1. Fundraising agent drafts a grant application or external proposal as a markdown file on a feature branch: `hq/fundraising/proposals/YYYY-MM-DD-<grant-name>.md`
2. Opens a GitHub PR against `main`
3. CEO reads the draft on GitHub, comments inline (edits, tone, concerns), or merges when satisfied
4. Only after merge does it get submitted externally

The PR *is* the review mechanism. The file in the PR *is* the proposal document.

### `website/content-drafts/` as PRs — handoff flow (comms → site-dev)

1. Communications agent writes a blog post, page copy, announcement, etc. as a file on a feature branch
2. Opens a PR — this is a handoff to site-dev, not a CEO approval step
3. Site-dev picks up the merged content and implements it (HTML, CMS, etc.)

Here the PR is an inter-agent handoff rather than CEO approval. Site-dev reads from `website/content-drafts/` after the content is merged.

---

### Underlying principle

Everything that matters passes through a GitHub PR because:
- CEO can read, comment, and edit inline on GitHub
- Merging = explicit approval signal
- Branch protection on `main` enforces it mechanically — no agent can bypass it
- Full history preserved in git

"Open a PR" in the brainstorm doc always means a real GitHub PR. The file in the PR is the artefact. The merge is the approval.
