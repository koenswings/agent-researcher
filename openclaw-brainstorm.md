# IDEA Virtual Company — Brainstorm

*Brainstorming session — no configuration changes made yet.*

**OpenClaw** is the self-hosted AI assistant platform already running on this Pi at `/home/pi/openclaw`. It manages multiple AI agents, each tied to a workspace (a codebase directory), and is accessible from any device on the Tailscale network at `https://openclaw-pi.tail2d60.ts.net`.

**IDEA** (Initiative for Digital Education in Africa) is the charity this virtual company serves. It deploys Raspberry Pi-based offline school computers running Engine and Console into rural African schools.

The goal is to configure OpenClaw to run the IDEA virtual company: multiple agents, each playing a specific role, coordinating through shared files and a CEO approval loop.

---

## How OpenClaw Already Maps to the Virtual Company

OpenClaw's agent model is a direct fit:

| OpenClaw concept | Virtual company concept |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Agent (`id` in openclaw.json) | A team member / role |
| `workspace` | The codebase or work area that role owns |
| `AGENTS.md` in the workspace | The role definition — instructions, responsibilities, constraints |
| `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_MODE=plan` (already set in compose.yaml) | CEO approval loop — agents always show their plan before acting |
| Browser UI at tailscale URL | The "office" — you open an agent's tab to interact with that role |

**The plan permission mode is the key insight.** It is already set. Agents never act unilaterally — they always propose what they intend to do and wait for approval. This IS the CEO approval mechanism, built in.

For code changes specifically, the additional layer is **GitHub branch protection**: agents open PRs on feature branches, and only you can merge to `main`. This prevents any code from landing without explicit review.

---

## The Agent Roster

Each IDEA role becomes one agent entry in `openclaw.json`, with its own workspace and `AGENTS.md`.

**Full agent roster:**

| Agent id | Workspace (host path) | Role |
|----------|----------------------|------|
| `engine-dev` | `/home/pi/projects/engine` | Engine software developer |
| `console-dev` | `/home/pi/projects/console-ui` | Console UI developer (Solid.js, Chrome Extension) |
| `site-dev` | `/home/pi/projects/website` | Builds and maintains the IDEA public website |
| `quality-manager` | `/home/pi/projects/hq/quality-manager` | Cross-project quality and consistency reviewer |
| `teacher` | `/home/pi/projects/hq/teacher` | Creates offline teacher guides for rural schools |
| `fundraising` | `/home/pi/projects/hq/fundraising` | Researches grants, tracks donors, drafts proposals |
| `communications` | `/home/pi/projects/hq/communications` | All external communication and public presence |

*Note: existing `engine` and `console-ui` entries in openclaw.json must be renamed to `engine-dev` and `console-dev`.*

The `quality-manager`, `teacher`, `fundraising`, and `communications` agents are given subdirectories inside `hq/` as their workspace. This gives each its own `AGENTS.md` while keeping them inside the shared HQ directory tree. Because `/home/pi/projects` is fully mounted into the container as `/home/node/workspace`, every agent can read any other project if its AGENTS.md instructs it to — the QM in particular needs this to review code across all repos.

---

## The HQ Directory

`/home/pi/projects/hq/` is the company's coordination hub. It is a git repo in its own right. Structure:

```
hq/
  BACKLOG.md                      ← master backlog, covers all projects
  ROLES.md                        ← agent roster with links to all AGENTS.md files (explains split)
  CONTEXT.md                      ← shared knowledge: mission, solution, key concepts (read by all agents)
  PROCESS.md                      ← how ideas become backlog items
  standups/
    2026-02-20-morning.md
  design/                         ← RFC-style design docs for complex features
  proposals/                      ← new ideas awaiting CEO approval
    YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md
  quality-manager/
    AGENTS.md                     ← quality manager role definition
  teacher/
    AGENTS.md                     ← teacher role definition
    getting-started.md
    kolibri-guide.md
    nextcloud-guide.md
  fundraising/
    AGENTS.md                     ← fundraising role definition
    opportunities.md
    grant-tracker.md
    proposals/
  communications/
    AGENTS.md                     ← communications manager role definition
    brand/
      tone-of-voice.md            ← how IDEA writes and speaks
      key-messages.md             ← what IDEA is, why it matters, our asks
    website/                      ← content drafts for site-dev
    donors/                       ← newsletter and impact report templates
    grants/narratives/            ← grant application narrative sections
    partners/                     ← partner outreach templates
    press/                        ← press releases and media kit
```

The `BACKLOG.md` is the single source of truth for what needs to be done across all projects. Any agent can propose additions; only the CEO approves them.

---

## AGENTS.md — The Role Definition File

Each workspace has an `AGENTS.md` that shapes the agent's behaviour. For example:

**`/home/pi/projects/engine/AGENTS.md`** (Engine Developer):
- You are the Engine software developer for IDEA
- Tech stack: TypeScript, Node.js, Automerge, Docker, zx
- Your work lives on feature branches; open a PR for every change
- Every PR must include: code changes, tests, and updated documentation
- For complex features, propose a design doc in `hq/design/` first
- The engine runs unattended in rural schools with no IT support — reliability is paramount
- Consult `hq/BACKLOG.md` for approved work items

**`/home/pi/projects/hq/quality-manager/AGENTS.md`** (Quality Manager):
- You are the Quality Manager for IDEA
- Review open PRs across `/home/node/workspace/engine` and `/home/node/workspace/console-ui`
- Check: tests present, docs updated, change consistent with architecture, offline resilience preserved
- Raise concerns in PR comments; never approve or merge — that is the CEO's role
- Read the latest standup from `../standups/` before each review session

**`/home/pi/projects/hq/fundraising/AGENTS.md`** (Fundraising Manager):
- You are the Fundraising Manager for IDEA, a charity deploying offline school computers in rural Africa
- Research and track grant opportunities: EU development funds, UNESCO, UNICEF, Gates Foundation, Raspberry Pi Foundation, national development agencies
- All outputs are documents for CEO review — never make external contact autonomously
- Maintain `opportunities.md` and `grant-tracker.md`
- Draft proposals in `proposals/` as PRs for CEO approval before any submission
- Hand narrative writing to the Communications Manager with a clear brief

**`/home/pi/projects/hq/communications/AGENTS.md`** (Communications Manager):
- You are the Communications Manager for IDEA, a charity deploying offline school computers in rural Africa
- Define and maintain IDEA's brand voice (`brand/tone-of-voice.md`, `brand/key-messages.md`)
- Draft all external-facing content: website, donor newsletters, grant narratives, partner outreach, press
- All outputs are drafts for CEO review — never send, post, or publish anything externally
- Website content goes in `website/content-drafts/` as PRs for `site-dev` to implement
- Grant narratives are written from briefs provided by the Fundraising Manager in `hq/fundraising/proposals/`
- The Quality Manager reviews your drafts for factual consistency with project documents

**`/home/pi/projects/hq/teacher/AGENTS.md`** (Teacher):
- You are the Teacher documentation specialist for IDEA
- Audience: teachers in rural African schools, limited technology experience, no internet
- Guides must work fully offline — they will be served from the Engine or printed
- Cover the deployed apps: Kolibri, Nextcloud, offline Wikipedia
- Keep language simple and concrete. Use screenshots or diagrams where possible.
- Flag any guide that needs review by an actual teacher before deployment

## CEO Approval — Two Layers

**Layer 1 — Plan mode (already active):** Every agent shows its plan before acting. You approve or modify before it executes. This applies to all work.

**Layer 2 — GitHub PRs (to be set up):** All code and document changes land on feature branches. The agent opens a PR. You review on GitHub and merge (or request changes). Branch protection on `main` in every repo enforces this mechanically.

For complex engine or console changes, a third gate applies:
1. Agent proposes a design doc in `hq/design/` → you approve via PR merge
2. Implementation PR is raised only after the design is merged

---

## CEO Tools & Daily Workflow

### Tool Stack

| Tool | Purpose | When you use it |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **OpenClaw Web UI** | Direct agents, approve plans, run standups | Daily — primary interface |
| **GitHub** | Review and merge PRs (code and documents) | Whenever agents raise PRs |
| **Terminal (SSH / Tailscale SSH)** | Pi administration, Docker, logs | Occasional — infrastructure changes only |

### Using the OpenClaw Web UI

Access at `https://openclaw-pi.tail2d60.ts.net` from any device on the Tailscale network.

The UI presents each agent as a separate chat tab. Your workflow in each tab:

| Step | What you do | What happens |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Direct** | Open an agent's tab, type a task | e.g. "Pick the next backlog item and propose your approach" |
| **Review plan** | Agent proposes exactly what it will do before acting | This is `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_MODE=plan` — the agent always stops here |
| **Approve / redirect** | Type "go ahead" or modify the plan | Agent executes only after your explicit approval |
| **Observe** | Watch tool calls, file edits, git operations stream in real time | You can interrupt at any point |

The "A return + waiting emoticon" in the chat is the agent presenting its plan and waiting for your go/no-go. It is not a bug — it is the CEO approval loop working as intended.

**Which agent tab to use for what:**

| Agent tab | Use it to... |
|-----------|-------------|
| `engine-dev` | Assign Engine coding tasks, review technical proposals |
| `console-dev` | Assign Console UI tasks |
| `site-dev` | Assign website content and build tasks |
| `quality-manager` | Request a cross-project review or PR analysis |
| `fundraising` | "What grants should we be applying for right now?" |
| `communications` | "Draft a donor update for this month" |
| `teacher` | "Write a Kolibri getting-started guide for teachers" |

### A Typical CEO Day

```
Morning
  └─ OpenClaw: standup agent → "run morning standup" → approve plan → read result
  └─ GitHub: review any PRs raised overnight → merge or comment

During the day
  └─ OpenClaw: fundraising → "what grants close this quarter?" → approve → review output
  └─ OpenClaw: engine-dev → "pick the next backlog item" → approve → it opens a PR
  └─ GitHub: quality-manager has commented on a PR → read, decide, merge

As needed
  └─ OpenClaw: communications → "draft a donor update from this month's commits" → approve
  └─ GitHub: review the comms draft PR, edit inline, merge when satisfied
```

**Key mental model:** OpenClaw is where you direct work and approve plans. GitHub is where you review and accept finished work.

---

## Complementary Open Source Tools

OpenClaw's web UI is the primary dashboard — there are no third-party dashboards built specifically for it. These tools add useful capability around it:

### Portainer — Docker management UI
The most immediately useful addition. Gives a web UI to see all running containers, their health, logs, and resource usage — without needing SSH.

- Runs as a Docker container alongside OpenClaw
- Useful for monitoring the OpenClaw container itself and checking logs

### Plane — project management (open source Jira/Linear alternative)
If `hq/BACKLOG.md` as a markdown file starts to feel limiting, Plane provides a proper board and backlog UI with issues, cycles, and modules. Self-hostable on the Pi.

### n8n — workflow automation
Useful for automating the standup trigger, scheduled agent prompts, or GitHub notifications. Rather than running `./standup morning` manually, n8n can trigger it on a schedule.

### Grafana — monitoring dashboards
Visibility into Pi health (CPU, memory, temperature, disk usage) — relevant for an always-on device deployed in a rural school. Pairs with Prometheus for metrics collection.

---

## Mission Control — An Alternative Operating Layer

[openclaw-mission-control](https://github.com/abhi1693/openclaw-mission-control) is a purpose-built
dashboard for running OpenClaw at team scale. It adds a Kanban board, structured task dispatch,
real-time agent monitoring, and built-in approval flows on top of the OpenClaw gateway. It runs as
a Next.js application (port 4000), connects to the OpenClaw gateway via WebSocket (port 18789),
persists state in SQLite, and deploys as a Docker container. The project is under active development
— production-grade architecture, but expect occasional breaking changes.

### What Changes in the Setup

**Additions:**
- Mission Control runs as an additional Docker container alongside OpenClaw, added to `compose.yaml`
- A bearer token (`LOCAL_AUTH_TOKEN`, minimum 50 characters) links it to the OpenClaw gateway
- A one-time board hierarchy is configured in the MC UI: **IDEA org → Board Groups (Engineering, HQ)
  → Boards per agent or project → Tasks** (the backlog items)
- A second Tailscale-accessible URL for the MC UI (e.g. `https://openclaw-pi.tail2d60.ts.net:4000`)

**Unchanged:**
- `openclaw.json` — agent config, workspaces, plan mode, and sandbox settings are untouched
- `AGENTS.md` files — role definitions are unaffected
- Sandbox files — IDENTITY, SOUL, USER, TOOLS, HEARTBEAT, BOOTSTRAP are unaffected
- The HQ directory structure on disk

**Retired:**
- `hq/BACKLOG.md` as the live task view — the MC Kanban board replaces it. BACKLOG.md could be
  kept as a git-native audit log or retired entirely once MC is the source of truth.

### What Changes in Daily Operations

**Task dispatch moves to the Kanban board.** Instead of opening an agent's chat tab and typing
"pick the next backlog item", you create a task in MC and assign it to the relevant agent. The board
columns — Planning → Inbox → Assigned → In Progress → Review → Done — give a single-screen view of
all 7 agents' work simultaneously.

**Plan approval still happens in individual agent tabs.** Mission Control dispatches work, but
`DEFAULT_PERMISSION_MODE=plan` is unchanged. After assigning a task, you go to that agent's chat
tab to read and approve its plan before anything executes. MC does not replace this layer.

**The activity timeline partially replaces the standup script.** MC provides a real-time SSE-fed
activity log across all agents. The morning standup becomes a scan of that timeline rather than
triggering a script to generate `hq/standups/YYYY-MM-DD-morning.md`. The standup script can still
run if a written record is preferred.

**The proposal/PR flow is unchanged.** MC tasks are the implementation-level view. The GitHub
PR-based proposal and review process remains the approval layer for finished work.

### Revised CEO Tool Stack

| Tool | Purpose | When you use it |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Mission Control** | Live Kanban across all 7 agents; task creation and assignment; activity timeline | Daily — primary dispatch surface |
| **Individual agent tabs (OpenClaw UI)** | Approve plans, have in-depth sessions, run ad-hoc tasks | After each task assignment, and for complex conversations |
| **GitHub** | Review and merge PRs (code and documents) | Whenever agents raise PRs |
| **Terminal (SSH / Tailscale SSH)** | Pi administration, Docker, logs | Occasional |

### Revised Typical CEO Day

```
Morning
  └─ Mission Control: scan activity timeline → see what ran overnight
  └─ GitHub: review any PRs raised overnight → merge or comment

During the day
  └─ Mission Control: create task for fundraising → assign → open agent tab → approve plan
  └─ Mission Control: move engine-dev task to "In Progress" → open tab → review progress
  └─ GitHub: quality-manager has commented on a PR → read, decide, merge

As needed
  └─ Mission Control: assign comms task ("donor update") → open tab → approve plan
  └─ GitHub: review the comms draft PR, edit inline, merge when satisfied
```

**Key mental model with MC:** Mission Control is where you see the full picture and assign work.
Agent tabs are where you have the conversation and approve plans. GitHub is where you accept
finished work.

### Fit for IDEA

**Pros:**
- Single-screen visibility across all 7 agents — no tab-switching just to see what's in progress
- Built-in approval flows and RBAC formalise the CEO role in the UI itself
- REST API makes standup automation and task state queries straightforward without parsing markdown
- Directly replaces the need for Plane (from the Complementary Tools list above) and reduces the
  need for Portainer
- Purpose-built for OpenClaw — won't drift out of sync as the gateway evolves

**Cons:**
- Additional process on a constrained Raspberry Pi (memory, CPU — worth benchmarking)
- SQLite state lives outside git — less auditable than commits to `BACKLOG.md`
- Under active development — breaking changes possible between updates
- One more URL and port to route through Tailscale
- One-time cost to migrate the existing backlog items into the MC board hierarchy

**Verdict:** Mission Control is a clear upgrade to the operating experience once the base 7-agent
setup is stable. It is not a prerequisite for launch — the base setup (plan mode + GitHub PRs +
`BACKLOG.md`) works without it. The recommended path is to launch with the base setup, run it for
a few weeks, then add Mission Control when the workflow is understood and the Pi's headroom is
confirmed.

## Daily Standups — Practical Mechanics

A standup is an agent session seeded with a specific context prompt. The simplest implementation is a script you run manually (or via a systemd timer) that:

1. Reads `hq/BACKLOG.md`, recent git commits across all repos, open PRs, and the last standup
2. Opens a Claude session (in the context of a dedicated `standup` agent, or any agent) with that context
3. The agent produces a structured standup document saved to `hq/standups/YYYY-MM-DD-morning.md`
4. You read it, add your priorities or decisions as a CEO comment, and commit

Whether to automate this via a cron/systemd timer or keep it manual is an open question — see below.

---

## File System Structure — Agent Config Location

### The observed split

Developer agents (`engine-dev`, `console-dev`, `site-dev`) have their `AGENTS.md` inside their own
code repositories. Coordination agents (`quality-manager`, `teacher`, `fundraising`,
`communications`) have theirs under `hq/`. This can feel inconsistent at first glance.

### Why it is actually intentional

**Developer agents are tied to a codebase.** Co-locating `AGENTS.md` in the repo is the standard
Claude Code convention — the file is discovered automatically from the project root and tells the
agent how to work in that specific repo. The config belongs alongside the code it governs, just like
`package.json` or a `Makefile`.

**Coordination agents produce documents, not code.** They have no code repository of their own.
The `hq/` repo is the only repo they work in, so their `AGENTS.md` naturally lives there as a
subdirectory.

### Options considered

**Option A — Co-location (current as-is):** `AGENTS.md` in each agent's primary workspace;
coordination agents in `hq/` subdirs.
- ✅ Natural home; standard Claude Code convention for developer agents
- ❌ Three separate repos to scan when looking for all agent configs; non-obvious to new contributors

**Option B — Centralise all in HQ:** Move all `AGENTS.md` to `hq/engine-dev/`, `hq/console-dev/`,
`hq/site-dev/` alongside the coordination agent subdirs.
- ✅ Single repo to find all agent definitions
- ❌ Breaks co-location convention; developer agents must look in a different repo for their own instructions; code repos become "bare" with no configuration

**Option C — Hybrid: co-location + explicit HQ index (selected):** Keep `AGENTS.md` in each
workspace (code repos for developers, HQ subdirs for coordinators). Improve `hq/ROLES.md` to
explicitly document where each agent's config lives and why, with links — making it the single
navigation point even though configs are distributed.
- ✅ No duplication; no broken convention; developer agents find instructions in their own repo
- ✅ `ROLES.md` already serves as the team roster — it just needs the explanation and links

**Option D — One dedicated repo per agent + one shared company repo:** Every agent gets their own
git repository. Coordination agents (`quality-manager`, `teacher`, `fundraising`, `communications`)
move from `hq/` subdirs into dedicated standalone repos. The `hq/` repo is stripped to purely
shared coordination content (CONTEXT.md, ROLES.md, BACKLOG.md, PROCESS.md, standups/, design/,
proposals/) — no agent workspace content at all.

Repo count: 7 agent repos + 1 company repo = **8 repos total** (vs 4 in Options A/C).

```
idea-edu-africa/
  engine           ← engine-dev workspace (unchanged)
  console-ui       ← console-dev workspace (unchanged)
  website          ← site-dev workspace (unchanged)
  quality-manager  ← NEW: own repo (currently hq/quality-manager/)
  teacher          ← NEW: own repo (currently hq/teacher/)
  fundraising      ← NEW: own repo (currently hq/fundraising/)
  communications   ← NEW: own repo (currently hq/communications/)
  hq               ← company repo: CONTEXT.md, ROLES.md, BACKLOG.md,
                      PROCESS.md, standups/, design/, proposals/
```

Key consequence: `AGENTS.md` co-location now works **uniformly for all 7 agents** — every agent's
config is at the root of their own repo. The developer/coordinator split disappears entirely.

- ✅ Structural confusion disappears — every agent has the exact same setup (own repo + company repo)
- ✅ Standard Claude Code convention (`AGENTS.md` at repo root) applies to all agents without exceptions
- ✅ Clean git history per agent: teacher guide commits live only in the teacher repo
- ✅ Independent per-repo access control if needed (e.g. make teacher guides public separately)
- ✅ Company repo is purely coordination — no workspace noise
- ✅ Pattern scales cleanly: adding a new agent = create a new repo
- ❌ Four additional GitHub repos to create, configure, and maintain (branch protection ×4)
- ❌ Coordination agents' path to shared files changes: BACKLOG.md is now in the company repo
  (`/home/node/workspace/hq/BACKLOG.md`) rather than `../BACKLOG.md` — a minor AGENTS.md update,
  not a real obstacle since all repos are mounted in the same container directory
- ❌ One-time migration effort: move content out of `hq/` subdirs into new repos

### Decision ✅

**Currently: Option C.** The split is documented in `ROLES.md` with links and explanation.

**Note for review:** Option D directly addresses the original concern — the structural confusion —
rather than patching it with documentation. The cost is 4 additional repos and a one-time migration.
If conceptual uniformity matters more than minimising repo count, Option D is the stronger choice.
This decision is worth revisiting before the full implementation starts.

## Shared Agent Knowledge — CONTEXT.md

### The problem

Technical knowledge about App Disks, Engine, Console, offline-first operation, and data
synchronization currently lives primarily in `engine-dev/AGENTS.md`. But every agent needs this
understanding:

- `teacher` must explain app usage accurately to non-technical school staff
- `fundraising` must describe the solution credibly to grant reviewers
- `communications` must explain how the system works in public-facing writing
- `quality-manager` must catch when changes break architectural principles (e.g. offline-first)
- `site-dev` must present the product accurately on the website

`SOUL.md` (shared across all agents) covers values and behaviour but not factual product knowledge.
Individual `AGENTS.md` files describe roles, not the product. There is no shared knowledge base.

### Options considered

**Option A — Extend SOUL.md:** Add "What we build" and "How it works" sections to the existing
shared SOUL.md.
- ✅ Already loaded by all agents; zero new files
- ❌ Conflates values/behaviour with factual product knowledge; SOUL.md becomes harder to maintain
and update as the product evolves

**Option B — Per-agent CONTEXT.md in each sandbox:** Write a tailored `CONTEXT.md` per agent,
calibrated to each role's depth of technical knowledge.
- ✅ Can be tailored (engine-dev gets deep technical detail; fundraising gets high-level)
- ❌ Seven copies to maintain; any factual update requires seven edits; drift is inevitable

**Option C — Single `hq/CONTEXT.md` read by all agents (selected):** One file in the HQ repo.
All agents read it at the start of each session (referenced in HEARTBEAT.md). Covers:
1. **Mission** — Who IDEA serves, what problem it solves, why it matters
2. **Solution overview** — What the system does at a high level
3. **Key concepts** — Engine, Console, App Disks, offline-first, data synchronization, physical web
   app management
4. **Guiding principles** — Reliability > features, no internet dependency, teacher-friendly
- ✅ Single source of truth; one edit propagates to all agents via normal git/PR workflow
- ✅ Factual knowledge cleanly separated from values (SOUL.md) and role instructions (AGENTS.md)
- ✅ Maintained like any other HQ document — QM reviews for factual accuracy

**Option D — Embed context in each AGENTS.md:** Expand the "Context" section in every role
definition file. Some AGENTS.md files already partially do this.
- ✅ No new files
- ❌ Duplication across seven files; no guarantee coordination agents are updated when technical
  concepts evolve; becomes inconsistent over time

### Decision ✅

**Option C.** Add `hq/CONTEXT.md` as the shared knowledge base for all agents. Keep SOUL.md for
values/behaviour and AGENTS.md for role-specific instructions. All agents read CONTEXT.md at the
start of each session via HEARTBEAT.md.

---

## Decisions

1. **Rename `engine` → `engine-dev`?** ✅ Yes.
2. **Rename `console-ui` → `console-dev`?** ✅ Yes. Website agent is `site-dev`.
3. **Standup: automated or manual?** ✅ Manual trigger for now — `./standup morning`.
4. **HQ repo: public or private?** ✅ Public. All repos under the GitHub org will be public.
5. **GitHub Organisation name?** → **`idea-edu-africa`** (not yet created). Repos currently live under the personal account `koenswings` and will be transferred to the org when it is created. See availability table:

   | Name | Available? |
   |------|-----------|
   | `idea-africa` | ❌ Taken (existing "IDEA Africa" org) |
   | `idea-edu-africa` | ✅ Available |
   | `idea-offline` | ✅ Available |
   | `offline-schools` | ✅ Available |
   | `appdocker` | ❌ Taken |

6. **Teacher guides delivery?** ✅ All three: served from Engine, embedded in Console UI, printable PDFs.
7. **Website technology?** ✅ Static site (Astro or Hugo — TBC) hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Backlog Growth Process

Growing the backlog is a collaborative, PR-driven process. Full details in `hq/PROCESS.md`. Summary:

### The pipeline

1. **Anyone proposes** — any agent (or CEO) creates `hq/proposals/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` and opens a PR.

2. **Cross-team refinement** — relevant agents are tagged in the PR. Examples:
   - Fundraising identifies a need for usage analytics → tags `engine-dev` for feasibility,
     `console-dev` for UI impact, `quality-manager` for privacy review
   - Teacher spots a missing app feature → tags `engine-dev` to scope it
   - Communications needs new content → tags `site-dev` for implementation assessment

   Agents comment on the PR with technical context, estimates, concerns, or sub-proposals.
   The **Quality Manager** reviews all proposals for cross-project consistency.

3. **CEO decides** — merges (approved → backlog), requests changes, or closes (declined).

4. **Backlog entry** — on merge, a concise entry is added to `hq/BACKLOG.md` with a link to the proposal.

### Why this works

- Any team member can surface a need regardless of role
- Ideas get cross-functional input before the CEO sees them
- Nothing lands in the backlog without explicit approval
- The full proposal history is preserved in git

## What Needs to Happen (in order)

1. ✅ Decide answers to the open questions above
2. ✅ Set up project repos: `engine`, `openclaw`, `idea-proposal` on GitHub
3. ✅ Set up VS Code / Claude Code / tmux per-project session pattern across all three projects
4. Review and approve the full proposal in `/home/pi/projects/idea-proposal/` (AGENTS.md files, sandbox files, openclaw.json)
5. Create GitHub Organisation (`idea-edu-africa`) and transfer existing repos; create new repos (`console-ui`, `website`, `hq`)
6. Create project directories on the Pi: `console-ui/`, `website/`, `hq/` with subdirs
7. Copy approved `AGENTS.md` files from proposal into each workspace
8. Apply updated `openclaw.json` (rename existing agents + add new ones)
9. Copy sandbox files (IDENTITY, SOUL, USER, TOOLS, HEARTBEAT, BOOTSTRAP) into each agent's OpenClaw sandbox
10. Restart OpenClaw: `sudo docker restart openclaw-gateway`
11. Set up branch protection on `main` in each GitHub repo (CEO-only merge)
12. Pair your browser with each new agent in the OpenClaw UI
13. Run the BOOTSTRAP session for each new agent to confirm identity and orientation
