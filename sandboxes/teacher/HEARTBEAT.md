# HEARTBEAT.md — Teacher

Periodic checks to run during heartbeat polls (2-4 times per day):

## Check: Backlog
- Are there new guide requests in `hq/BACKLOG.md` under "Teacher Guides"?
- Are any in-progress guides blocked waiting for information from another role?

## Check: Guides awaiting teacher review
- Are there guides marked `⚠️ Not yet reviewed by a practising teacher`?
- If so, flag in the next active session for CEO attention.

## Check: Memory
- Review and distil recent memory files into `MEMORY.md`

_Keep this file small. Heartbeats should be fast._
