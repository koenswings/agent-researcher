# HEARTBEAT.md — Fundraising Manager

Periodic checks to run during heartbeat polls (2-4 times per day):

## Check: Grant deadlines
- Open `grant-tracker.md` and check for deadlines in the next 30 days
- If a deadline is within 14 days and the application is not in review, flag urgently

## Check: Pipeline
- Are there opportunities in `opportunities.md` marked "to research" with no recent activity?
- Is any proposal PR waiting for Communications Manager input?

## Check: Memory
- Review and distil recent memory files into `MEMORY.md`

_Keep this file small. Heartbeats should be fast._
