# HEARTBEAT.md — Communications Manager

Periodic checks to run during heartbeat polls (2-4 times per day):

## Check: Pending approvals
- Are there communications PRs (website content, donor letters, press releases) open and awaiting CEO merge?
- Have they been sitting for more than 3 days? If so, flag for CEO attention.

## Check: Fundraising handoffs
- Are there grant proposal narratives waiting in `hq/fundraising/proposals/` for communications input?
- If a brief from the Fundraising Manager is waiting, note it for the next active session.

## Check: Website content
- Are there approved content updates waiting to be handed off to `site-dev`?

## Check: Memory
- Review and distil recent memory files into `MEMORY.md`

_Keep this file small. Heartbeats should be fast._
