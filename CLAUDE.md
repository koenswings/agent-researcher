# IDEA Proposal Project Guide

## Overview
This project contains planning and proposal documents for the IDEA virtual company — the configuration of OpenClaw to run IDEA (Initiative for Digital Education in Africa) as a multi-agent AI-assisted organisation.

Documents here are proposals awaiting CEO approval. Once approved and implemented, they migrate into the relevant operational project (primarily `/home/pi/openclaw`).

## Structure
- **`README.md`**: Overview of the proposal and approval process.
- **`openclaw-brainstorm.md`**: The main planning document — agent roster, HQ structure, workflows, decisions, and backlog.
- **`proposals/`**: Individual proposal documents awaiting CEO approval.

## Lifecycle
1. Ideas and plans are drafted here as proposals.
2. The CEO reviews and approves via this project's Claude session (`claude-idea`).
3. Approved items are implemented and their documentation moves to the appropriate project.
